1. Which data structure did you choose to implement? (Array or Linked List)\
I chose to implement a Linked List as I already had a template for the class and would not have to change around the array functions.

2. What challenges did your choice of data structure present when reading the file?
There was no real challenge because the Linked List accepted every type and I did not decide to group the vertices or faces together.

3. Does the data structure choice have any effect on the process of reading the file?
Yes it does because if it was an array I could have more easily created a 2D Array where as with the Linked List I would have to store a Linked List inside of 
another Linked List resulting in a 2D Linked List if I wanted to do the same thing.  But I decided to do some funky math to get around that.

4. How did you build up your lists? Add one element at a time? Or create the full list and set each element one at a time?
I added one element at a time because we already had the pushback function implemented for the Linked List.

5. What challenges did your choice of data structure present when validating the file?
This was probably the hardest part for the Linked List because I did not create a 2D Linked List and had to do a bunch of weird math in order to access and verify the correct
values in the file.

6. Does the data structure choice have any effect on the process of validating the file?
It absolutely does as I do not have experience with 2D Linked Lists and did not want to mess with it whereas 2D array's I am completely comfortable with.

7. What challenges did your choice of data structure present when printing data from the file?
No challenges really as I had already solving accessing the data problem in the validation part and basically just did similar math from that.

8. Does the data structure choice have any effect on the process of printing data from the file?
It has little effect if any, it may be easier in an array but it's basically the same, just depends on how you validate the file.
