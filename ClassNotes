Making Node- just make node 
Add front- make a node for the head, if empty make it the head, if not make a new node-point at the old node-change new node to the head.
Traverse and Print everything- create a current node(to avoid losing reference), in loop check that it is not null and print currnode value and point it to the next
Size- Do above and just count
min/max- same thing iterate through and determine value bigger or smaller
find- traverse and set a conditional for the value you want and count the values until you get the value
remove front- create a node to delete pointer and set it to head, set head to next value, delete og pointer

Class- creates new data type or add functionality to existing types
Object- variable/instance of defined class
class.object
UML- attributes(variables) and behaviors(functions)
Class- Declaration and Definition- declares data methods(functions) and members(variables)
Scope required for funciton implementation

Constructor function to avoid it not existing- Enforce rules for constructing here as well
Add parameters to constructor if needed
Use private section to enforce rules
Getters and Setters- ways to call private variables without allowing access and to change private variables

overload base operators with our class as well
Destructor, Copy Assignment(Deep), Copy Constructor(Deep) (Rule of 3- make all of them if you make one)
