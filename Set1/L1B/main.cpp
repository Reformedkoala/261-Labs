// The include section adds extra definitions from the C++ standard library.
#include <iostream> // For cin, cout, etc.

// We will (most of the time) use the standard library namespace in our programs.
using namespace std;

// Define any constants below this comment.

// Must have a function named "main", which is the starting point of a C++ program.
int main() {

  /******** INSERT YOUR CODE BELOW HERE ********/

  cout << "Hello world!" << endl; // print Hello world! to the screen

  /******** INSERT YOUR CODE ABOVE HERE ********/

  return 0; // signals the operating system that our program ended OK.
