For this lab, your tasks are as follows.  Provide the answers after each number.  Show your work for each step.

1a. Convert the decimal number 1,904,803,840 to 32-bit two's complement binary representation.


1b. Represent the value in hexadecimal. 


2a. Convert the decimal number -1,047,986,176 to 32-bit two's complement binary representation.


2b. Represent the value in hexadecimal.


3a. Convert the decimal number 17.125 to 32-bit floating point precsision.


3b. Represent the value in hexadecimal.


4a. Convert the decimal number -17.125 to 32-bit floating point precision.


4b. Represent the value in hexadecimal.


5a. Convert the hexadecimal value 0xC3890000 to binary.
find binary representation of each hex digit to get 4 bit representation of each digit then combine into the binary representation
i.e c = 1100, 3 = 0011, 1000
11000011100010010000000000000000

5b. Convert the binary to a signed decimal integer value using two's complement.


5c. Convert the binary to a floating point decimal value.


6.  Using a terminal, perform the following steps.  List the commands used to perform the tasks:

- print the current directory you are in when the terminal opens
pwd

- move into the lab1b_folder directory
cd .\lab1b_folder\

- list the contents of the directory
ls

- move into the data directory
cd .\data\

- rename the misspelled file fil2.txt to be file2.txt
mv fil2.txt file2.txt

- copy file1.txt to be file3.txt
cp file1.txt file3.txt

- make a new file named file4.txt
ni fil4.txt

- move to the parent directory
cd ..

- make a directory named bin
mkdir bin

- compile main.cpp into an executable
g++ main.cpp

- move the generated executable into the bin folder and rename it to be lab1b
mv a.exe .\bin\

- print the current directory you are currently in
pwd

- run the new executable from your current directory
.\bin\a.exe
